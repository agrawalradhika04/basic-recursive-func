# basic-recursive-func
This project contains recursive implementations for a set of foundational programming exercises. This project features recursive implementations for a series of classic algorithmic problems. It includes functions to compute the maximum value in a vector, calculate powers of two, count character occurrences in a string from a given position, and generate a repeated output pattern. Each function is tested via user input to demonstrate its behavior and correctness.
